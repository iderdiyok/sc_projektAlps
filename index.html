            <h2>Choose your trip</h2>
            <p>
                We choose hotels which offer a great location, a high standard of comfort and quality, and a solid value
                to
                our guests. These inns offer a superbly satisfying mix of a welcoming atmosphere, traditional cuisine,
                and
                authentic charm. They are typically small, independently-owned properties which reflect the character
                and
                hospitality of the surrounding alpine community. We know the owners personally, have a longstanding
                relationship with them, and we find they bend over backwards to provide our guests with an exceptional
                experience.
